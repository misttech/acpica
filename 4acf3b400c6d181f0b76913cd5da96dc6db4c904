      "message": "Just to make sure I follow, the problem was that `AmlStart` could be NULL at the same time `AmlLength` was zero, so the UB was that it was doing `NULL + 0`?\n\nWhereas now it unconditionally sets up the pointer and only does the addition if `AmlLength` is non-zero, which implies that `AmlStart` will be a valid pointer? If that\u0027s the case, would `if (AmlStart !\u003d NULL) {` be more correct?",
