This include would essentially resolve to the non-existent path //third_party/acpica/src/devices/board/drivers/x86/OWNERS, instead of to the intended path //src/devices/board/drivers/x86/OWNERS.\n\nThe next best thing, as much as it pains me, is to copy the contents of src/devices/board/drivers/x86/OWNERS into this file.",
